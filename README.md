# flask-vue-todo

> A todo app with Vue and backed by Flask

ðŸš€ [Live Demo](https://fv-todo.herokuapp.com)
![preview](/preview.png)

The demo is deployed on Heroku's free dyno and provides an interface of register/login for the use of a small group of users.

## Start frontend development server

``` bash
cd frontend
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build
```
Replace `yarn` with `npm` if you are using `npm`. Frontend pages will be served at http://localhost:8080

***Note**: In this mode, the backend is not available yet, any server request will fail on the page. It is only for frontend debugging.*

## Start flask development server

``` bash
# In the repo root, install all dependencies
pipenv install

# Init DB
pipenv run flask db upgrade

# Start development server
FLASK_ENV=development pipenv run flask run
```
Pages will be served at http://localhost:5000.

***Note**: In this mode, all pages are served by Flask, so you need to build the frontend before this step.*
