Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like. Don't go into this decision dead-set on one species or breed -- being open-minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family. Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets:<br>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Dogs</b> - though dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam.</li>
					<li><b>Cats</b> - Intelligent and individual, cats will be fine with less supervision, though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out.</li>
					<li><b>Hamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents</b> - Economical and short-living, rodents make good first pets. They often, however, have strong odors.</li>
					<li><b>Fish</b> - Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive, and won't cuddle anytime soon. Think of having a fish like having a garden.</li>
					<li><b>Lizards</b> - Happy on their own and generally easy to care for, lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick.</li>
					<li><b>Birds</b> - Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud. They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental, especially bigger birds like parrots.</li>
					<li><b>Rabbits</b> - Rabbits are friendly first-time pets that make a great contribution to the household. However, they can easily make a lot of noise and mess.</li>

					<ul>
					<li>Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the "herd," the collie will try to get it back. How does it do it with the sheep? It bites them. This may result in grave injuries to children. Please do your research on how breeds behave.</li>
					<li>It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter.</li>
					<li>For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out.</li></ul></td>
